          So, far all you know about me is that my name is Orne and I am an
          Aupair.<br />How on earth am I supposed to start answering the
          question <em>why?</em>.... I am 25 years old, I love children and my
          career is accounting, yes! i am an accountant, it has nothing to do
          with kids, not at all, I think that's exactly why I chose to be an
          Aupair.<br />By definition, an aupair is
        </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Au_pair">
          <p>
            "A helper from a foreign country working for, and living as part of,
            a host family. Typically, au pairs take on a share of the family's
            responsibility for childcare as well as some housework, and receive
            a monetary allowance for personal use."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        What i really think? An aupair is the person that walks with the kid
        through their childhood. Is the person who guides, who listens, who is
        there for the kid when their parents can't. Is a member of the family,
        as simple as that.<br />
        Many people often ask me the secret to have an amazing year abroad and
        all I can say is:
        <ul>
          <li>Trust your gut</li>
          <li>Communicate with your host family</li>
          <li>Choose your battles</li>
          <li>Have a solid support system</li>
          <li>Make friends and travel (if possible)</li>
          <li>Be a team player, the host family is there for you!</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        I hope you are enjoying reading my blog as much as i enjoy writing
        it.<br />
        Love,
